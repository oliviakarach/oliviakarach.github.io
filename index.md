## Welcome to my page!

I am a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh spending my college experience exploring the intersection of economics and philosophy. I have a particular passion for how these areas apply to health economics and public policy. I was able to pursue my policy interest through my first research experience documenting women's rights legislation around the globe. 
My academic load is counterbalanced by two part time jobs with Kaplan and the University tutoring center. For the latter position, I am a Nationally Certified tutor with specializations in micro and macroeconomic theory.
